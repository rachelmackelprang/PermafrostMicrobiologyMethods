# DNA-RNA co-extraction from humic-rich soils

### Supplies
  * RNeasy PowerSoil Total RNA Kit. Cat. No. / ID:12866-25
  * RNeasy PowerSoil DNA Elution Kit Cat. No. / ID:12867-25
  * Bead beater with adapter for 15 ml conical tubes. We use the FastPrep-24 Classic bead beating grinder and lysis system (SKU: 116004500) with the TeenPrep adapter (SKU: 116002526). 
  * Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol (25:24:1, v/v), pH 5.4
  * Optional: RNeasy PowerClean Pro Cleanup kit Cat. No. / ID: 13997-50
  * Optional: DNeasy PowerClean Pro Cleanup kit Cat. No. / ID: 12997-50

### Protocol

The protocol follows the kit manufacturer's instructions with the following alterations. In our experience, these alterations increase yields by at least 2-5 fold
  * The kit protocol calls for Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol pH 6.0-8.5. We have had better success with a pH of ~5.4. 
  * The kit protocol calls for samples to be homogenized on a Vortex Adapter (cat. no. 13000-V1-15). We have had better success using a bead beater at 4.5 m/s for 20 sec. 
  * Optional: Elute in 50 ul rather than 100 ul if you expect concentrations to be low.
